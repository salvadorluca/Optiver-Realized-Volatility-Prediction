# Project Overview

This project involves various stages of data analysis and model implementation for a competition dataset. The main components include data preprocessing, Explorative Data Analysis (EDA), and model training. Below are the detailed instructions for each component.

## Main

The `main.ipynb` notebook contains all the models used in this project. To run these models, ensure you have a directory named `data` in your working directory with the following files:
- `train.parquet`
- `test.parquet`
- `val.parquet`

You can download these files from [this link](https://epflch-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/marco_giuliano_epfl_ch/Evkg__kBJSlGuxZpKEOPHmIB0LQYr-qH4zAsaDHdo1gmpA?e=B3Ozhq).


## Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)

The `EDA.ipynb` notebook can be used to reproduce the plots included in our report. To run this notebook, you need:
- The original competition files
- Preprocessed data files

Download all necessary data from [this link](https://epflch-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/alessandra_digiacomo_epfl_ch/Documents/eda?csf=1&web=1&e=q4MLqC) and place them in your working directory.

## Data preprocessing

The `data_preprocess.ipynb` notebook is used to create variables and group them into 10-second windows. You need the original competition data files in your working directory to execute this notebook. You can find the original data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/data).

Alternatively, you can use the already processed data available at [this link](https://epflch-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/marco_giuliano_epfl_ch/Evkg__kBJSlGuxZpKEOPHmIB0LQYr-qH4zAsaDHdo1gmpA?e=B3Ozhq).
